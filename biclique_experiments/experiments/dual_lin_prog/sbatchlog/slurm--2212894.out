(CVXPY) Sep 21 10:27:09 AM: Your problem has 343 variables, 2 constraints, and 0 parameters.
(CVXPY) Sep 21 10:27:09 AM: It is compliant with the following grammars: DCP, DQCP
(CVXPY) Sep 21 10:27:09 AM: (If you need to solve this problem multiple times, but with different data, consider using parameters.)
(CVXPY) Sep 21 10:27:09 AM: CVXPY will first compile your problem; then, it will invoke a numerical solver to obtain a solution.
